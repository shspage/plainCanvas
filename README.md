(It says "CSXS.10", but the number varies depending on the Illustrator's version. ex."CSXS.11" for Ai 2024(28.2))

### buttons on the panel
* __in__ : imports selected paths on the artboard onto the canvas
* __out__ : exports the image created on the canvas onto the artboard
* __run__ : executes a script that has an executable function
* __opt__ : shows/hides the form for optional values
* __&#60;__ : undo
* __&#62;__ : redo
* __CL__ : clears the canvas
* __DB__ : opens the debug tool with a default browser.
* __RL__ : reloads the extention panel
* __load__ : opens a dialog to select a script file to lead

### loading a script file
* Drag and drop a script file you want to load onto the panel.  
You can also use __load__ button to select a script file.
* Drawing on the panel will be cleared after loading is complete.

### script files that can be loaded
* There're some sample scripts in "[scripts](https://github.com/shspage/plainCanvas/tree/master/scripts)" folder.  
* Write in __JavaScript__ (not paperscript).  For details, see "[Using JavaScript Directly](http://paperjs.org/tutorials/getting-started/using-javascript-directly/)" in http://paperjs.org.  
__ex:__ new Path() -> new paper.Path()   // or use "with(paper){" statement  
__ex:__ point1 + point2 -> point1.add(point2)  
__ex:__ function onMouseDown(event) -> tool.onMouseDown = function(event)  
* Set the character encoding to __UTF-8__.
* You can use the UIs for optional values with simple methods. see "js/optionManager.js".
* You can set a drawn object as a target for undo/redo by calling the method like this.
```javascript
undoManager.keep(object);
```
Note that undoed objects are just hidden, and still exists in the current paper.project.



### colors
* Since html5 canvas uses RGB color, imported CMYK and GRAY colors may look different from they look on the artboard.
* If ALWAYS_EXPORT_RGB (js/main.js) is set false, the original CMYK colors are kept in memory
and are applied when they are exported. (When DefaultColorSpace of the artboard
is CMYK.)
* If ALWAYS_EXPORT_RGB is true, GRAY colors are exported in RGB.
* Gradient color and spot color are not supported for now.

### exports to an artboard
* Following attributes of paper.Path instance on the canvas are exported.  
_segments, strokeWidth, strokeColor, fillColor, opacity_

### imports from an artboard
* Following attributes of selected PathItems are imported.  
_pathPoints, strokeWidth, strokeColor, fillColor._
* Grouped paths and compoundpaths are imported in released condition.
